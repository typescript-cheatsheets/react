## All React + TypeScript Cheatsheets

- **The Basic Cheatsheet** ([`/README.md`](/README.md#basic-cheatsheet-table-of-contents)) is focused on helping React devs just start using TS in React **apps**
  - focus on opinionated best practices, copy+pastable examples
  - explains some basic TS types usage and setup along the way
  - answers the most Frequently Asked Questions
  - does not cover generic type logic in detail. Instead we prefer to teach simple troubleshooting techniques for newbies.
  - The goal is to get effective with TS without learning _too much_ TS.
- **The Advanced Cheatsheet** ([`/ADVANCED.md`](/ADVANCED.md)) helps show and explain advanced usage of generic types for people writing reusable type utilities/functions/render prop/higher order components and TS+React **libraries**.
  - It also has miscellaneous tips and tricks for pro users.
  - Advice for contributing to DefinitelyTyped
  - The goal is to take _full advantage_ of TypeScript.
- **The Migrating Cheatsheet** ([`/MIGRATING.md`](/MIGRATING.md)) helps collate advice for incrementally migrating large codebases from JS or Flow, **from people who have done it**.
  - We do not try to convince people to switch, only to help people who have already decided
  - ⚠️This is a new cheatsheet, all assistance is welcome
- **The HOC Cheatsheet** ([`/HOC.md`](/HOC.md)) specifically teaches people to write HOCs with examples.
  - Familiarity with [Generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html) is necessary.
  - ⚠️This is the newest cheatsheet, all assistance is welcome
