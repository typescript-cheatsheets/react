**This Advanced Cheatsheet** helps show and explain advanced usage of generic types for people writing reusable type utilities/functions/render prop/higher order components and TS+React **libraries**.

- It also has miscellaneous tips and tricks for pro users.
- Advice for contributing to DefinitelyTyped
- The goal is to take _full advantage_ of TypeScript.

**Creating React + TypeScript Libraries**

The best tool for creating React + TS libraries right now is [`tsdx`](https://github.com/palmerhq/tsdx). Run `npx tsdx create` and select the "react" option. You can view [the React User Guide](https://github.com/palmerhq/tsdx/issues/5) for a few tips on React+TS library best practices and optimizations for production.

- Be sure to also check [`basarat`'s guide](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/quick/library.html) for library tsconfig settings.
- From the Angular world, check out https://github.com/bitjson/typescript-starter
