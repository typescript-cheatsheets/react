We will assume knowledge of utility types covered in the sister project [`typescript-cheatsheets/utilities`](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/utilities). Look up libraries included there as well for your typing needs.

If you intend to maintain a large TS codebase/a nontrivial React+TS library, **we strongly recommend exploring these utilities** so that you don't reinvent the wheel and/or lose sanity trying to do so. Studying their code can also teach you a lot of advanced TS that is not covered here.

I also recommend having a good working knowledge of how to construct the inbuilt utility types from scratch. See [Dr. Rasuchmeyer's guide](https://2ality.com/2020/06/computing-with-types.html) for a concise introduction.

A level of comfort with **generic types** is therefore required. Here are some helpful resources:
