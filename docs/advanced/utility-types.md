We will assume knowledge of utility types covered in the sister project [`typescript-cheatsheets/utilities`](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/utilities). Look up libraries included there as well for your typing needs.

If you intend to maintain a large TS codebase/a nontrivial React+TS library, **we strongly recommend exploring these utilities** so that you don't reinvent the wheel and/or lose sanity trying to do so. Studying their code can also teach you a lot of advanced TS that is not covered here.
