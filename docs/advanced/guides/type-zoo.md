As you can see from the Omit example above, you can write significant logic in your types as well. [type-zoo](https://github.com/pelotom/type-zoo) is a nice toolkit of operators you may wish to check out (includes Omit), as well as [utility-types](https://github.com/piotrwitek/utility-types) (especially for those migrating from Flow).
