title: Migrating (to TypeScript) Cheatsheet
---

This Cheatsheet collates advice and utilities from real case studies of teams moving significant codebases from plain JS or Flow over to TypeScript. It makes no attempt to _convince_ people to do so, but we do collect what few statistics companies offer up after their conversion experience.

> ⚠️ This Cheatsheet is extremely new and could use all the help we can get. Solid advice, results, and up to date content all welcome.

## Prerequsite

Read [TypeScript's official Guide for migrating from JS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/migrating-from-javascript.html) and you should already be familiar with their [React conversion guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Conversion-Guide#typescript-react-conversion-guide).
