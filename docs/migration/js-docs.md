- https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/JsDoc-support-in-JavaScript
- webpack's codebase uses JSDoc with linting by TS https://twitter.com/TheLarkInn/status/984479953927327744 (some crazy hack: https://twitter.com/thelarkinn/status/996475530944823296)

Problems to be aware of:

- `object` is converted to `any` for some reason.
- If you have an error in the jsdoc, you get no warning/error. TS just silently doesn't type annotate the function.
- [casting can be verbose](https://twitter.com/bahmutov/status/1089229349637754880)
