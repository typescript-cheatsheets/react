Use [declaration merging](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html):

```ts
// declaration.d.ts
// anywhere in your project, NOT the same name as any of your .ts/tsx files
declare module "*.png";

// importing in a tsx file
import * as logo from "./logo.png";
```

Note that `tsc` cannot bundle these files for you, you will have to use Webpack or Parcel.
