Believe it or not, we have only barely introduced TypeScript here in this cheatsheet. There is a whole world of generic type logic that you will eventually get into, however it becomes far less dealing with React than just getting good at TypeScript so it is out of scope here. But at least you can get productive in React now :)

It is worth mentioning some resources to help you get started:

- Step through the 40+ examples under [the playground's](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html) Examples section, written by @Orta
- Anders Hejlsberg's overview of TS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET4kT88JRXs
- Marius Schultz: https://blog.mariusschulz.com/series/typescript-evolution with an [Egghead.io course](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-static-types-in-typescript)
- Basarat's Deep Dive: https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/
- Rares Matei: [Egghead.io course](https://egghead.io/courses/practical-advanced-typescript)'s advanced TypeScript course on Egghead.io is great for newer typescript features and practical type logic applications (e.g. recursively making all properties of a type `readonly`)
