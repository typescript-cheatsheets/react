### Option 1: Using react-error-boundary

[React-error-boundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) - is a lightweight package ready to use for this scenario with TS support built-in.
This approach also lets you avoid class components that are not that popular anymore.

### Options 2: Writing your custom error boundary component

If you don't want to add a new npm package for this, you can also write your own `ErrorBoundary` component.

```jsx
import React, { Component, ErrorInfo, ReactNode } from "react";

interface Props {
  children?: ReactNode;
}

interface State {
  hasError: boolean;
}

class ErrorBoundary extends Component<Props, State> {
  public state: State = {
    hasError: false
  };

  public static getDerivedStateFromError(_: Error): State {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  public componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {
    console.error("Uncaught error:", error, errorInfo);
  }

  public render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Sorry.. there was an error</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;

```
