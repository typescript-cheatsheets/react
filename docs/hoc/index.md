title: HOC Cheatsheet
---

**This HOC Cheatsheet** compiles all available knowledge for writing Higher Order Components with React and TypeScript.

- We will map closely to [the official docs on HOCs](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) initially
- While hooks exist, many libraries and codebases still have a need to type HOCs.
- Render props may be considered in future
- The goal is to write HOCs that offer type safety while not getting in the way.
